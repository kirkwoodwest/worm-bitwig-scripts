Bitwig Scripts for the Worm Control

This is all temporary stuff. what is it? .js based bitwig scripts on 3.1.3 and API 10. 

Excuse me while I remember how to code and use Git. Switching between a record label, social media manager, musician, graphic designer is blowing my mind.


Just started this project a week ago so there are plenty of debug prints, mispellings, poorly formatted code. My brain is going a little bit too fast to fully get behind a certain format or even methodology. Perhaps when I'm up to 0.5 in the proof of concept i'll go back to formatting code and cleaning things out. For now I'm learning too many things at once, so dropping them into source control makes the most sense right now. Why am I blogging here?
